![](media/image-20251118112440080.png)

## 1. Description

Doing experiment with electronic products, we often program on the Arduino IDE development environment with Arduino series microcontrollers. 

Keyestudio Uno PLUS control board is fully compatible with Arduino IDE development environment. It is as same as the Arduino UNO R3 board. Moreover, some improvements we made highly strengthen its function(as shown below). In order to wire efficiently, we equip with a 1m USB cable with type-c interface for you.

### 5.2 Installing Driver

1、**Windows System**

**Checking the driver**

1. Connect the motherboard to the computer.

**Manual driver installation**

1. Driver download

- Windowns System:[Windowns System driver](./Windows.7z)

2. Connect the motherboard to the computer, open the device manager, if there is a yellow exclamation mark in front of the driver in the picture, it proves that the driver is not installed, please download the driver and install it manually.

2、**MAC System**

**1 Checking the driver**

Connect the development board to the computer, according to [Tools] ---> [Port] to select the development board port (Note: If you can not confirm which port is the development board, please connect the motherboard to take pictures to record all the ports, and then unplug the development board to re-take pictures to record all the ports, and then compare to find the disappeared ports, and then unplug the motherboard after the disappeared ports is the port of the board, and then select the port on the line)If you can not recognize the port, please replace the computer USB port or around the phone cable to re-recognize the port, if it still does not work refer to the following steps to install the driver.
